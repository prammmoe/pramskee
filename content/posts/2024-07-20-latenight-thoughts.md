It's 12:27 AM tonight in Indonesia Western Time. Still cannot get some sleep 'cause I have to think about my work programme for my Field Study and Community Service that will be held in this morning. Still cannot have a better programme to think and brainstorm about. When I try to think and work about it, it gets so blurry and I don't know where to led it to.

What a fool to think that Field Study and Community Service is an easy program to work in especially in this 7th Semester. It was hard guys--maybe just at the start, hopefully. Let's end this day with a good quality sleep and praying that tommorrow will get better.
